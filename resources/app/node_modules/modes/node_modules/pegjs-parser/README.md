Common resources used by parsers generated with PEG.js

# File system layout

* `initializer.ls`: a module gathering everything that should be exported for initialization blocks of grammar files.
* `helpers.ls`: contains utility functions to be used inside grammar files, where the code is really repetitive, follows some pattern, and is somewhat constrained.
* `test.ls: __TO MOVE__ a module able to _visually_ test parsers generated by PEG.js

## Implementations

* `parser.ls`: `Parser`

# Versioning

To version: _everything_.

## Development

### Initializer

You can gather anything you want to expose to PEG.js grammar in the _initializer_ module file.

This file should not contain any logic, it should just import modules and re-export them, gathering the whole, and possibly renaming, aliasing, whatever.

It's just a bridge between code and PEG.js grammars.

### Helpers

Add in the _helper_ module file anything that would simplify code in PEG.js grammars.

Inside it, you will find code that will reduce boilerplate, workaround some limitations, etc.

### Parser

You can work on the _parser_ module file. Please refer to the section about the `Parser` model.

# Parser

A wrapper for PEG.js generated parsers.

This module is an adapter for parsers generated by PEG.js.

It's a wrapper class that will know how to make the parsing service defined for _modes_ work with such kind of parser.

___Pending concept___: the rest of this section needs review and work

It uses the generated parser to parse an input, and then is able to do some post-processing, and so on.

You can either use it, in this case it's more or less like using the generated parser, or sub-class it, to implement post-processing.

## Post-processing


The generated parser does really little things. It's almost like a token wrapper, just ordering them into a tree.

It is really hard to do a lot in the grammar, which has a limited concept, and is stuck to be used through a DSL.

The post-processing is there to do several things:

* fix
* compute
* re-arrange
* transform
* ...

# FIXME

* The node model is too close to the use that is made by PEG.js: move some things to the NodeInstancier that would be the bridge between PEG.js and the Node model. Then, change the Node class, with a better constructor, and move it at the proper location in the file system
