# 3rd party libraries

## Outliners

None, we use a pure custom implementation, are this is something rather opiniated.

## Validators

* [JSHint](http://jshint.com/)

## Highlighters

* Custom?

## Formatters

* [esformatter](https://github.com/millermedeiros/esformatter), based on [rocambole](https://github.com/millermedeiros/rocambole)
* [js-beautify](https://npmjs.org/package/js-beautify)

## Parsers

All parsers are compliant to the [Mozilla Parser API specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API)

* [Esprima](http://esprima.org/): maybe the fastest and most famous JavaScript parser implemented for JavaScript
* [reflect.js](https://github.com/zaach/reflect.js): supports the [_builder objects_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API#Builder_objects) defined in the specification, so that we can directly build our custom model from the parser
