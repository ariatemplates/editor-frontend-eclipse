The goal is to define and get a custom model returned from the parser, ideally a powerful graph.

# TODO

The building functions could be defined in a more declarative way:

* the name of the function (we can keep the current grouping feature)
* for each argument - that is for each position - the name of the resulting key, and the destination of it: `properties` or `children`
* if really needed, provide a function instead of the object described above
