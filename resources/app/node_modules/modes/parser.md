This article discusses about the creation of a parser.

There are always several solutions to a problem. Here are a few concerning parsing:

* create the parser from scratch, coding everything
* code directly the parser but using specific libraries for this purpose (parser combinators for instance)
* use a grammar and a tool to generate the parser from it

If we put aside possible performance issues or very specific things, the last one seems the best.

> Why?

A language, as everything, corresponds to a model. A grammar is a way to define an instance of this model. If we can have a fully working parser generated from a grammar, this means two things:

* our language is conform to the model, and thus every theory around it is available, along with tools and so on
* we can save time by generating something complex instead of writing it ourselves, thanks to a tool (as mentionned in the previous point)

> So, what's next?

1. Determine which model the language you want to build a parser for corresponds to, then you'll be able to know which kind of grammar you can use to define it
1. Choose a flexible enough tool to generate a parser for this language running on the system you chose

> What are the limitations?

The problem often comes from the tools, not the limitation of the model. Some tools won't produce parsers with enough features.

One of the main lacks in this field for instance concerns incremental parsers.
