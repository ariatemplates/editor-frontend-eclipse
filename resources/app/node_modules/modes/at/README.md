## DRY

The services implemented by this module are based on a model generated by the parser.

For PEG.js generated parsers, this model is common, so are the implementations of the services.

A common class should be made, and each module would either use it or subclass it. For instance, there might be custom outlining rules, ...

Moreover, the JS module whihc uses an external parser should convert the generated model to the one defined for PEG.js generated parsers. Traversing the generated AST and building a graph in parallel using the Node class methods should be easy.
