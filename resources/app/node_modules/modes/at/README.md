## FIXME

* The stylesheet is taken from the JS module, adapt it to the actual type names ( _tokens_ ) used in this mode.

## Backlog

1. Improve the parser (refer to the parser module documentation)
1. Customize the mode for several features (when they will be available through the standard mode library)
	* complete highlighting stylesheet
	* provide outline rules
	* ...
1. ...

### Sub-languages rules

For highlighting or outlining for instance, a mode will provide a set of rules that are used in a generic implementation of these two features.

Consider highlighting, it uses style definitions, and name of node types to know where to apply those styles.

In the case of Aria Templates, we can't consider anymore giving only the _simple_ type of a node, a more precise, comprehensive type definition should be given, considering which language is used.

Change the highlithing module accordingly (maybe the frontend implementation too), and modify the stylesheet of this mode to use that.
