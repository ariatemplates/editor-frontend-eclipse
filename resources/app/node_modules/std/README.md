___DON'T EDIT THIS MODULE___

[ymeine](https://github.com/ymeine): these files come from my own standard library, which I maintain personally.

I will make them accessible more easily in the future (own project, npm package, ...).

__For documentation__: have a look at the source code, which is documented. In case you want to have a look at the implementation itself, you can compile the LiveScript sources to JavaScript if you better understand it.
