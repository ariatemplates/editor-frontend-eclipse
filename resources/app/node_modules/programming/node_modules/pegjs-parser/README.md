Common resources used by parsers generated with PEG.js

# File system layout

## `helpers.ls`

Contains utility functions to be used inside grammar files, where the code is really repetitive, follows some pattern, and is somewhat constrained.

## `initializer.ls`

Is just a module gathering everything that should be exported for initialization blocks of grammar files.

## `node.ls`

The implementation of a node/graph, which is the data model for a parsed text.

## `parser.ls`

__Pending concept__

A wrapper for PEG.js generated parsers. It uses the generated parser to parse an input, and then is able to do some post-processing, and so on.

You can either use it, in this case it's more or less like using the generated parser, or sub-class it, to implement post-processing.

# Concepts

## Parsing

### Post-processing

The generated parser does really little things. It's almost like a token wrapper, just ordering them into a tree.

It is really hard to do a lot in the grammar, which has a limited concept, and is stuck to be used through a DSL.

The post-processing is there to do several things:

* fix
* compute
* re-arrange
* transform
* ...

The following sections describe the processing to be done, in order.

#### Pruning

The goal is to remove unecessary nodes from the graph.

For instance, whitespaces, comments.

For now, I'd better keep everything, as this is used for editing.

#### Graph

Waiting for a good graph library to be done, for now the only things that will be done is to put links between nodes.
