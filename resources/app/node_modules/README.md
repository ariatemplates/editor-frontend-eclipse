## Development

___You should not touch the [`std`](./std) module___, except for quick fixes if urgent, but they are part of an external project. It will be the same for the [`oop.js`](./oop.js) library.

To develop modes, please refer to the [`modes`](./modes) module itself.

### OOP

#### Refactoring

Group the `oop`and `dop` modules, in a parent module about _data oriented programming_.

#### Alternative

Maybe choose a suitable OOP library. For now I use JSClass, which is probably too much for only this. An immediate alternative would be JSFace. However many others exist: my.Class, Klass, Classy, PTClass, ...
