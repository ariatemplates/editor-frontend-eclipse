Mix of application modules and personal standard modules.

# File system layout

* `modes`: modules providing source code edition services. 1 module = 1 language.
* `server`: __STD__ a library to run a server, with a _sub-library_ for JSON-RPC.
* `std`: __STD__ basic core/standard library.

# Versioning

To version

* `modes`

Optional:

* `server`: is part of an external project, and is imported manually. For now, it's better to version them for simplicity and safety
* `std`: _idem_

To ignore: _none_

# Contribute

## Pre-requisites

## Development

___You should not touch the `server` and `std` module___, except for quick fixes if urgent, but they are part of an external project.
