Mix of application modules and _personal standard modules_.

# File system layout

* `README.md`: this current file
* `modes`: modules providing source code edition services. 1 module = 1 language.
* `std`: __STANDARD__ library with:
	* basic core/standard library
	* a library to run a server, with a _sub-library_ for JSON-RPC.
* `oop.js`: __STANDARD__ library for object oriented programming and object management (properties, etc.)

# Versioning

Optional:

* `std`: is part of an external project, and is imported manually. For now, it's better to version it for simplicity and safety.
* `oop.js`: __IS NOT OPTIONAL FOR NOW__ but should be externalized, integrated to the previously described standard library

To version: __everything else__.

## Development

___You should not touch the `std` module___, except for quick fixes if urgent, but they are part of an external project. It will be the same for the `oop.js` library.

To develop modes, please refer to the `modes` module itself.

### OOP

#### Backlog

* For callable instances: give the user the possibility to specify a name for a prototype function, equal to the `call` function. This way, both `instance()` and `instance.<whatever-name>()` will be possible.

#### Refactoring

Split the `oop` module in two, one for class creation, the other for properties management, the former using the latter of course. However, these two modules can reside in a parent module about _data oriented programming_.

#### Alternative

Maybe choose a suitable OOP library. For now I use JSClass, which is probably too much for only this. An immediate alternative would be JSFace. However many others exist: my.Class, Klass, Classy, PTClass, ...

## Documentation

Document the `oop` module (both code and doc).
