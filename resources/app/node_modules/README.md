Mix of application modules and _personal standard modules_.

# File system layout

* `modes`: modules providing source code edition services. 1 module = 1 language.
* `std`: __STD__ std library with:
	* basic core/standard library
	* a library to run a server, with a _sub-library_ for JSON-RPC.

# Versioning

To version:

* `modes`

Optional:

* `std`: is part of an external project, and is imported manually. For now, it's better to version it for simplicity and safety.

To ignore: _none_.

# Contribute

## Pre-requisites

* Node.js
* LiveScript

## Development

___You should not touch the `server` and `std` module___, except for quick fixes if urgent, but they are part of an external project.

To develop modes, please refer to the `modes` module itself.
