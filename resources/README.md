# File system layout

## `app`

All files of the applications.

Parts of the application are modules, and are mixed with other own _standard_ modules (that you could see duplicated in other projects, as they are not integrated to the package management system - _npm_ here)

## `node_modules`

All 3rd party libraries used by the modules in `app`.

## Package

* `package.json.ls`: LiveScript equivalent of npm `package.json`
* `compile.bat`: generates `package.json` from `package.json.ls`
* `package.json`: to be ignored, generated by `compile.bat`
